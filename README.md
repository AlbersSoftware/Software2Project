# About This Project
A Desktop Application for Scheduling Appointments

 This application has a login form 
for security with marked user ID's 
and a main menu to navigate 
through the application pages. In 
this application you can add 
customers and appointment 
contacts, then with these added 
you can schedule appointments 
with given times, locations, 
descriptions, etc. You can save 
customer information and 
appointments made will adjust 
times based on their time zones to 
avoid timezone conflicts. There are 
many ways to search for an 
appointment or customer and a 
separate page was created for 
keeping appointment reports. This 
application uses MySQL database 
to store all information.

# Future Changes
In the future I would like to make a more modern UI and configure cloud storage options rather than the generic JDBC.
Potientially host this project as a web or phone app could give it more practicality as well.
